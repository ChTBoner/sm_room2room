# SM_ROOM2ROOM

An attempt at a Super Metroid Speedrun analysis tool.
(AKA an attempt at learning Rust)

## Goal
Then endgame here will be to have some sort of GUI (App or Webpage) to analyse Speedruns, with time data room by room, for precise analysis, with graphs, tables etc...

I am a father, a husband and have a job. This project will not take precedence over them.

## Requirements
For this tool to work, you will need either [QUsb2Snes](https://github.com/Skarsnik/QUsb2snes)
 or [SNI](https://github.com/alttpo/sni) running in the background

It will track runs running on original console and should work with Retroarch running bsnes.
(Bugs encountered on MacOs with retroarch)

## TODO
- Add timers for Boss fights
- Track Ceres Escape IGT
- Track Zebes Escape IGT (with and without the animals saved)
- Not everybody likes terminals so having a GUI would be great.

## Provided binaries
I will make a best effort to provide binaries for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

I do not have a MacOs with an ARM processor so no testing will happen for these binaries.
